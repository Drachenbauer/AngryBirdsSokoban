This is now an Angry Birds style version.

I turned the player-dot into a bird from the Angry Birds flock.

I turned the baggage into eggs.

I turned the storage area into nests.

And i added three wall-styles similar to the piggie-construct-materials in the official Angry Birds Games.


code-changes:

-four direction-pictures and hopping-animation for the bird (player)

-10 levels to choose

-three wall-styles to choose
