This is now an Angry Birds style version.

I turned the player-dot into a bird from the Angry Birds flock.

I turned the baggage into eggs.

I turned the storage area into nests.

And i added three wall-styles similar to the piggie-construct-materials in the official Angry Birds Games.


code-changes:

-four direction-pictures and hopping-animation for the bird (player)

-up to 10 levels to choose from

-four wall-styles to choose from

-added progress-strings to show number of solved eggs and as a step-counter

-added an undo-one-step-function


Controls:

arrow-keys:

You can´t push more than one egg with one move.
If you try to push two or more eggs in a row, your bird doesn´t move.

backspace-key:
Undo last move.
